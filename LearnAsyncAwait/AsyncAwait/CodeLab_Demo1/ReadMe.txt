1. Set 3 breakpoints
    one at line 10
    one at line 19
    one at line 29

2. Examin SomeMethod1 and SomeMethod2.
    Pay attention to the signature of the methods.
    You'll notice that SomeMethod2 does a (correct) call to read a file by using File.ReadAllTextAsync.

3. Run the application and write down the order in which the breakpoints are hit.

4. Now change line 8 so it calls SomeMethod2.

5. Run the application again write down the order in which the breakpoints are hit.

6. Compare the orders of the two scenarios.

7. Now examin SomeMethod3. 
   Is the signature the same as SomeMethod2 ? 
   What's the difference ?

9. Change line 8 so it calls SomeMethod3. 
    Notice the flyover warning and read it carefully.
    Add the await keyword before the SomeMethod3 call in line 8.
    You'll see the flyover warning has disapeared.

10. Now add a breakpoint in line 39.

11. Run the application again and write down the order in which the breakpoints are hit.

Final tought : Encourage yourself to avoid using async void methods.
